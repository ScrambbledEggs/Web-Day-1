<h4>verse 1</h4>
<p>There's a place down the street we call Sam's Place <br>
    It starts a-jumpin' every evening when the sun goes down<br>
    You can always find me down at Sam's Place <br>
    For that's where the gang all hangs around<br>

<h4>Chorus</h4>
<ul>There's ol' Shimmy Shakin' Tina <br>
    She hails from Pasadena <br>
    She always got a big smile on her face <br>
    There's Hootch-y-kootchy Hattie <br>
    she comes from Cincinnati <br>
    Yeah, there's always a party at Sam's Place<br>

<h4>Verse 2</h4>
<p>Well, they've got a swingin' band down at Sam's Place <br>
    You can hear 'em pickin' twenty blocks away <br>
    They're playin' country music down at Sam's Place <br>
    From the setting sun until the break of day <br>
